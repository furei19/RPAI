1. Make sure Python & venv are installed

Most Raspberry Pi OS versions have Python preinstalled. Check with:

python3 --version


If you don’t have venv, install it:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-venv -y

2. Create a virtual environment

Inside your project folder (where your Teachable Machine .py file is):

python3 -m venv venv


Activate it:

source venv/bin/activate


You should now see (venv) before your prompt.

3. Install dependencies

Teachable Machine exports usually need TensorFlow Lite or TensorFlow. On Raspberry Pi, TensorFlow Lite is lighter and works better.

Install pip & upgrade:

pip install --upgrade pip


Then install the libraries you need (depending on your export type):

For image classification:

pip install numpy pillow tflite-runtime


For audio classification:

pip install numpy sounddevice tflite-runtime


For pose detection / advanced models (may require full TensorFlow, but it’s heavy on Pi):

pip install tensorflow

4. Run your Teachable Machine Python file

If your export is named tm_model.py, run:

python tm_model.py
